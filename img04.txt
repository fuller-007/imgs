这幅画采用柔和温馨的色系，画面中两位女性的服饰颜色丰富，左侧站立的女性穿着米白色带有黄色花边的上衣，翠绿色背心和带有暗红色和绿色条纹的棕色裙子；右侧坐着的女性身穿蓝色带有金色点缀的灰色上衣和粉色裙子。周围环境更为素雅，墙面是砖红色和灰色，墙上的葡萄叶从深绿色逐渐变为干枯的黄褐色，墙角的叶子呈现出秋天特有的淡黄色和棕色，与地面上灰色到深灰色和褐色的石板道路呼应。右侧还有一张深棕色的木制椅子，上面搭着一块未完工的白色布匹。整体来看，这幅画营造了一种宁静、历史沉淀的色彩氛围；

This painting uses a soft and warm color scheme. The two women in the picture have rich clothing colors. The woman standing on the left is wearing a beige top with yellow trim, an emerald green vest, and a brown skirt with dark red and green stripes; the woman sitting on the right is wearing a gray top with blue and gold embellishments and a pink skirt. The surrounding environment is more elegant, with brick red and gray walls, grape leaves on the wall gradually changing from dark green to yellow-brown, leaves in the corner showing the unique pale yellow and brown of autumn, echoing the cobblestone road on the ground from gray to dark gray and brown. There is also a dark brown wooden chair on the right, with a piece of unfinished white cloth on it. Overall, this painting creates a tranquil and historical sediment color atmosphere;
